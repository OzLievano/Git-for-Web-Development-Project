Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Inline elements do not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Block elements always start on a new line and takes up the full width available.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? The element will respond to the dimensions of the document and not the parent. The parent will act as if that element does not exist.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Element-name{width:100%;}
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	block : div, footer, section
	inline: span, a, button
	inline-block: img
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? The box model is way to wrap around every HTML element define sections or spaces in between each other. Using the box-sizing CSS attribute we can set the value to 'border-box' that includes padding and borders to an element's width. Meaning if we have a box inside a box , the width can be set to 100% and if we have the box-sizing attribute then it will respect the width of the box and not the page.
